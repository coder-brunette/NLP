# Natural language processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.NLP often involves the use of machine learning techniques, including neural networks, deep learning, and other statistical methods. Pretrained language models like the one you're interacting with (GPT-3) have significantly advanced the state of the art in NLP, enabling systems to understand and generate human-like text at an impressive level.

NLP has numerous applications in various industries, including customer service, healthcare, finance, education, entertainment, and more. It has the potential to revolutionize the way humans and computers interact, making technology more accessible and intuitive for people all over the world.

This repository consists of 10 different projects based on fundamental concepts of NLP. Same were posted on my LinkedIn profile as a 10 NLP-series program created by me.
The topics covered are - 
1) Tokenization
2) Sequencing
3) Sentiment Recognition
4) Recurrent Neural Networks in NLP
5) LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model in NLP
6) Training an AI to create poetry
7) Stemming and Lemmatization
8) Bag of Words
9) Stop words
10) Word embeddings

I am adding the code as well the pdf which contains information on each topic respectively. If you need any more help or wanna chat about somethin', just give me a holler. We're in this together, ya know? Keep it real, yo!
